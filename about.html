      <h1>I am Demir.</h1>
      <p>I’m a 18-year-old software enthusiast with over three years of experience in software engineering. My primary focus is mobile app development, a passion that started when I was first introduced to informatics in school. That early curiosity led me to participate in programming olympiads — I proudly won 1st place twice for my school and later secured 1st place in the prestigious "Al-Khwarizmi" Olympiad.</p>

      <p>A key moment in my journey was when my teacher, Xusniddin, lent me his own laptop so I could practice programming at home. That act of support introduced me to the world of code — long before I had a device of my own. Today, I’m pursuing a Bachelor's degree under the Millat Umidi foundation and continue to explore the world of software development with the same curiosity I started with.</p>

      <p>Outside of tech, I have a deep interest in films — from storytelling and cinematography to the creative decisions of directors. It fascinates me how ideas turn into powerful visual experiences.</p>

      <p>So far, I’ve built several projects, including a Weather App, Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and a Fast-Food Delivery App for a local restaurant, among others. If you'd like to read more about my thoughts, reflections, experiences, and what I've learned along the way, check out the articles I post on the <strong>Reads</strong> page. See you there!</p>
